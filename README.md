# NBA Player Performance Model Evaluation
## Description
This repository houses a Python-based application designed to evaluate predictive models that analyze NBA player performance data. The program retrieves historical game logs via the NBA API, processes the data, and applies machine learning algorithms to assess the efficacy of different prediction models. Results, including actual versus predicted statistics, are visualized using matplotlib to demonstrate the accuracy of the models.

## Technology Stack
- **Python**: Main programming language for data fetching, processing, and evaluation.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Utilized for data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Used for implementing machine learning models.
- **Matplotlib**: Generates visualizations to compare predicted results against actual performance.
- **NBA API**: Provides access to historical player performance data.

## How to Run
1. **Clone the Repository:**
2. **Install Required Libraries:**
3. **Set Up API Access:**
- No API key is required; however, ensure you are connected to the internet to fetch data from the NBA API.

4. **Run the Program:**
   
Follow the prompts to enter the NBA player's full name and the seasons you're interested in.

5. **View Results:**
- After processing, the program will display the evaluation results and corresponding visualizations directly in your command line interface or a pop-up window (for graphs).
